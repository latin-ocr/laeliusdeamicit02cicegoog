Gracchus did not occur till 113 aa, six years aiter this conversation, but
as he had already shown marked ability and aggressiveness, Cicero puts
into the mouth ol laelius forebodlngs drawn from his own subsequent
knowledge. Deinde, a word 01 difficult explanation Sey. and L. refer

it to deflexit-consuetudo maiorum, as introducing the second point 01 de·
generacy, 1. e., res, the proposition to introduce the ballot, the first being
Gracchus‘ attempt to establisha monarchy. 1 preter,¹ with n, “to take
the remark 0011100000 perfectly general in scope, aud as intended
to give the reason why Laelius dreaded to think oi the future course 01
O. Gracchus. Deinde is here used prolepiicully, 1. e, it presupposes 0001,
which comes soon aiter. Translate: ‘affairs soon move on, for th'ey glidc
readily down the path 01 ruin when once they have taken a start’ ’² The

opinion since his speech against Rullus, 13 a 0., when he called the bal·
lot vindicem 1001100 libertates, ΙΙ. 2, 4. The lex Gabinia, which authorized
the ballct in voting for magistrates, was passed 131 s. ας 110 lex Cassia,
extending its use to public trials before the Comitia, 137 s. c. paud the
lex Papiria (see n. on Carbo, §39), 131 a. c. lan ante, i. 0., before
Oarbo's tribuneship. 'l'he two preceding sentences are parenthetieal.
Laelius does not 'mention the lex Papiria, because he had just referred in
general 10 110 acts 01 Carbo, which included this lex, aud which were
fresh in the minds oi his· hearers, but mentions only the two preceding
leges which had prepared the way for 'that oi Carbo. Iu the next sen-
tenaciam refers 10 110 time oi the conversation, and indicates the re·
sults of these popular mensures. 1111111111111, populace, used to avoid
the repetitiones populi, yet suggesting that the secret power of many
opened the door tor demagogism.
