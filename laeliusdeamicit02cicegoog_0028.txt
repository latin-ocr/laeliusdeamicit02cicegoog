NOTE.

———

Tua text adopted for this work is that of Baiter and ·

Kayser, the edition of 1860. It has been carefully com·
pared with Halm’s revision of Orelli's text, and with those
of other editors. Any changes from the standard text
have been noticed in the notes.

In preparing the noteS, the aim has been to furnish
explanations on points of grammar, history, biography,
and ancient customs, and, particularly by translation and
special remark, to indicate the different and the corre·
sponding idioms of the Latin and the English, and thus,

- through idiomatis English, to assist to a better under·

standing of the structure of the Latin. The student will
often find a careful studyof English idioms and construc-
tions avery useful help to the knowledge of the dissimilar
Latin.

Many editions have been consulted, and those from
which most important aid has been derived are mentioned
in the beginning of the notes.

Dmruouru Contrua,
Auyuet, 1882.
