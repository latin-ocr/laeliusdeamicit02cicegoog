elder. He was born about 186 Β. 0., and died at an un'-
certain date, but probably not lo'ng after Scipio. He was
prominent in the state, being plebeian tribune 151, praetor
145, and consul 140, holding also the office of augur. In
the third Punic war, as the lieutenant of Scipio, he ren·

own culture and the generous assistance he gave to others,
was very powerful in aid oi the new literary impulse.

The poet Terence was his friend, the purity of whose
Latinity was ascribed by many of that day to the revi-

by Cicero as occasionally rough aud archaie, was in gen-
eral noted ior its smoothness. His daughter Laelia, who
