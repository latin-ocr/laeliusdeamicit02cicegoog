“conversations of this sort, resting on the authority of
men oi earlier times and likewise renowned, seem for some
reason to possess greater weight.'' This conversation is
reported as having occurred soon after the death of Scipio,
129 B. c.

Time of oecumenica-The Laelius was written in 44
n. u, probably in the month of June, subsequently to the
cato Maior, to which it is a companion. The time was
one in which the first hopes for the restoration oi the re·
public, formed at the death of Gaesar, were turning into
disappointment, and the forebodings which Oicero puts
into the mouth of Laelius must be taken as the foreeast
which he was making for the state in his own times. Tha
careful student can not fail tc see in many places, and
especially in the discussion of the effect of friendship on
political action, the references to Gicero’s own times.

Sourcece-'l'he subject of friendship was one upon
which many Greek philosophers had written. Without
doubt Cicero was familiar with most, if not all, of their
writings, but imitations are infrequent. Gorrespondences
are noted between various parts oi the Laelius and a book
oi Theophrastus, περὶ φιλίας, Xenophon's raemoreeilie,
2, 4-10, embodying a discourse of Socrates on friendship,
and Plato’s Theaetetus and Lysia. But, ashes been said,
the work is not oi a character to have been drawn from
Greek sources. It is Oicero’s own development of the
subject, after reading the Greek authors, from his own
observation, experience‚ and reflection.
